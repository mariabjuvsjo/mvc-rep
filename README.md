Project in course MVC at BTH.

Second part of this repo is a project made in the course MVC objectoriented php.

I created a texas holdem game, where the user has to log in to be able to play. 

The user play agains the computer and the one with the best hand winns the total pot of "money".

To set this game in to action I worked with models, views and controllers, through the Symfony and twig framwork, with the PHP language.

I've used the symfonys log in system make:user and make:auth. Ive been wrking with sessions to hold the game throgh very get and plost request.
And to store the users data I've worked with doctrine and ORM.

There is also phpunit test on all my own created classes, along with other automatized tests such as metrics and scrutinizer.
